# Reserve
> **Definition**

```
GET https://api.ticketswitch.com/f13/reserve.v1/{username}?user_passwd={password}
```

Before purchasing tickets, you must first `reserve` them. Reserving tickets will
put them on hold for a period of time, ensuring they cannot be purchased by
anyone else until you explicitly [release](#release) them or until the hold time
expires when the tickets are automatically released. Reserve is typically called
before displaying a checkout page to customers to collect contact and payment
details.

There are two main use cases for calling `reserve`:

1. **You only want to purchase a single event**: call `reserve` with a
`perf_id`, `ticket_type_code`, `price_band_code`, `no_of_seats`, and other
optional parameters if necessary.

2. **You want to purchase multiple orders in a single transaction**: you must
first add orders to your [trolley](#trolley), then `reserve` the trolley by
specifying a `trolley_token`.

Note that in some rare cases it is not possible for Ingresso to hold the tickets
with the underlying supplier, although we will still tell you that your tickets
will be held for a period of time. Currently this only affects a small number of
suppliers of freesale attraction tickets, and does not affect any seated
tickets.

**********************
Due to the real-time nature of the ticketing systems it is possible that a
product which was available when an order was placed in the trolley has since
ceased to be available, thus it is not guaranteed that all the items in the
trolley will be reserved successfully. This method may therefore have a "partial
success" status in which only a subset of the orders were reserved successfully.
The failed orders will be listed in the output if this occurs.

During this time an appropriate set of information necessary to complete the
purchase must be collected and the reservation purchased. At the end of the time
period the reservation will be released back into the pool. The output from this
method indicates the information which is needed to make a successful purchase.
This always consists of the customer information, but may or may not require
payment card details. If a payment card is required then the types of cards
which are accepted will be indicated in the output. Customer data includes both
an email address and also an “agent reference” which can be generated by the
user of the core. These are normally optional, but under certain circumstances
may be compulsory. If this is the case then this will also be indicated in the
return. If any of the address data may be preffiled then this is also passed
back, togteher with a flag indicating whether or not it may be modified.
**********************

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`discX` | Specify a discount code for ticket number X, with zero-based numbering (so to specify the CHILD discount code on the second ticket use `disc1=CHILD`). Note that illegal discount codes are replaced with legal ones.
`no_of_seats` | The number of tickets you want to reserve.
`perf_id` | The performance identifier for the tickets that you want to reserve.
`price_band_code` | The price band identifier for the tickets that you want to reserve.
`remove_items_list` | A comma separated list of order `item_number`s that you want to remove from the trolley before reserving.
`req_currency_details` | Include full detail in the [currency object](#currency-object). Without this only the currency_code field is returned.
`seatX` | Specify a specific seat for ticket number X, with zero-based numbering (so to specify seat A12 as the first ticket use `seat0=A12`). If seat numbers are not specified then you will receive best available seats.
`X_send_code` | Specify a send / despatch method for supplier system X. If this is not present it will default to the first send method. For example, to specify the POST send method for the nimax supplier system, use `nimax_send_code=POST`.
`ticket_type_code` | The ticket type identifier for the tickets that you want to add to your trolley.
`trolley_token` | The identifier for a trolley. This is used to reserve multiple items at once.

The trolley has three main structures:

* A **`bundle`** represents all orders from  a particular supplier. Orders are
grouped like this so that all items are ordered from the  supplier at once - if
the supplier posts tickets on our behalf then separate orders will be posted
together, and if the supplier processes payment all orders in the bundle will be
paid for with a single payment. Reserving and purchasing orders will also succeed
or fail together.

* An **`order`** represents a number of tickets to a particular `price band` and
`ticket type`, for a particular [performance](#performances) of an
[event](#events).

* An `order` will contain multiple **`ticket_order`**s when more than one
`discount code` is used (for example ticket 1 and 2 have the ADULT discount
code, and tickets 3 and 4 have the CHILD discount code). In this example there
will be two `ticket_order`s: one for ADULT and one for CHILD.



******************************************
It is possible that none of the orders in the trolley are available when the
reservation request is made, and in this case a completely empty response will
be returned. This does not indicate an error from the cores point of view,
however, as this is part of the normal operation of the system.

Purchases may be made from the system either on-credit (with the user of the core taking the payment, and being invoiced later for the amount) or directly though the core, with the payment being taken directly from a customer’s card. Which of these systems is in use is indicated by the boolean element “need_payment_card” which is always present in the output. If this has the value “yes” then payment card details must be provided. The cards which will be accepted for the transaction are then listed in the element “acceptable_cards” which will be present if a card is required. This consists of a set of “card” elements, each containing the card type in “card_type” and a human description of the type in “card_desc”. The current list of known types is as follows.

access - Access
amex - American Express
diners - Diners Club
discover - Discover
electron - VISA/Electron
fraser - House Of Fraser
jcb - JCB
magasin - Magasin
marks - Marks and Spencer
mastercard - Mastercard
otb - OTB
searsuk - Duet/Sears
solo - Solo
style - Style
switch - Switch (with issue number)
switch_ni - Switch (without issue number)
visa - VISA/Delta
Some systems are capable of making an address check against a credit card before allowing it to be debited. Under normal circumstances this will be the address provided by the customer. Certain systems may allow a separate billing address to be specified so that the card used for payment need not be registered to the customer’s address. The boolean element “supports_billing_addr” indicates if this is the case. If it is “yes” then a separate address may be provided at purchase time, and this will be used to validate the card address should any such check be made.


Some commercial users, particularly those purchasing on-credit, will have an address already held in the system which should be prefilled for the user. If this is the case then an element “prefilled_customer_data” will be present containing all the address felds, the phone numbers and the email address to be prefilled (even if they are blank). This address is sometimes fixed and may not be edited by the user at all. This is indicated by the “can_edit” element within the prefilled data, which is either “yes” or “no”. Note that even if the address cannot be edited, it is still permissible to fill in any prefilled fields which are blank.
******************************************

Ingresso's partners split into the following categories based on how they take
payment:

* **On-credit**: those who purchase on-credit, and are invoiced by Ingresso

* **Stripe**: those who exclusively use Stripe to take payment, either
into their own bank account (and are invoiced by Ingresso) or directly into
Ingresso's bank account

* **Venue or other payment provider**: those who send payment direct to the
venue or to the payment provider specified by Ingresso.

Most partners are on-credit, some are Stripe-only, and very few are venue or
other payment provider - this is not typically offered to partners.


Partners who wish to take payment via Stripe should note the following:

* The simplest option is to use Ingresso's Stripe account, however it is
possible to use your own. Once this has been agreed you can contact Stripe, and
provide Ingresso with your Stripe keys.

* We recommend that you use [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/custom-form) to
collect card details on your own checkout page and pass them directly to Stripe
in a secure, PCI-compliant manner. When passing card details to Stripe you will
need to include a publishable key - this will be returned by Ingresso via
bundle.debitor.debitor_integration_data.publishable_key.

* If there are no errors with the card details then Stripe will return a single-
use Stripe token. You should then pass that token to Ingresso and we will ask
Stripe to authorise payment then, only if we successfully purchase tickets from
the supplier, we will ask Stripe to capture the payment. This is taken care of
by the Ingresso API. TODO: more detail on what is passed where.


Attribute | Description
--------- | -----------
`accepted_payment_cards` | A list of payment card types, for partners that use Ingresso to take payment (for example via Stripe), allowing you to display card type icons on your checkout page. If you purchase on-credit (and are invoiced by Ingresso) then you should ignore this. 
`allowed_countries` | A list of country codes and human-readable descriptions. The country codes are [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). This list is relevant when selecting a despatch method that is restricted to certain countries, for example a local post despatch method may only be available in the supplier's country. These are typically presented to customers in a dropdown list on a checkout page. The customer's country code is a required parameter when [purchasing](#purchase) tickets.
`can_edit_address` | Incicates whether it is possible to change the non-blank `prefilled_address` data. This is primarily for internal use and can be ignored for normal use cases. In most cases this will be `true`. If it is `false` the non-blank `prefilled_address` fields will be used when tickets are purchased and we will ignore these fields if they are passed to us. 
`needs_agent_reference` | For the vast majority of partners this will be `false` and can be ignored. However some partners ask to specify their own reference when purchasing tickets - if this is `true` then the reference must be passed in.
`needs_email_address` | If `true` you must pass in an email address when purchasing tickets.
`needs_payment_card` | This will be `false` for almost all partners (from the categorisation above those who purchase on-credit or use Stripe). If this is `true` you need to collect card details from the customer and include them when purchasing.
`prefilled_address` | 
`prefilled_address.address_line_one` | 
`prefilled_address.address_line_two` | 
`prefilled_address.country_code` | 
`prefilled_address.email_address` | 
`prefilled_address.home_phone` |
