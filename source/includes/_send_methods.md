# Send Methods

```
GET https://demo.ticketswitch.com/f13/send_methods.v1?perf_id={performanceid}
```

This section describes the available methods of delivery for a given
performance. Each method in the list has an associated cost which will be added
to the overall charge.

Send methods might change between performances and depending on times when they
are requested. For example there might not be enough time to post a physical
ticket to a customer before the performance starts, so those performances would
not have that option available. As such it's important that send methods are
called as needed to ensure the user isn't seeing options that are out of date.
