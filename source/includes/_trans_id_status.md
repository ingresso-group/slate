# Trans ID Status
> **Definition**

```
GET https://demo.ticketswitch.com/f13/trans_id_status.v1?transaction_id={trans_id}
```

This resource is to provide legacy API support. In the old XML API after
reserving  tickets a transaction ID was returned. This has been replaced with
a transaction UUID. If you have made purchases using the old XML API and you
need to retrieve details of the transaction then you can use
`trans_id_status` lets you request status for a particular `transaction_id`.
If you have only used this JSON API then there is no need to use
`trans_id_status`.

The returned attributes are dependent on the status of the transaction. For
example a purchased transaction will appear differently to a released
transaction.

Attribute | Description
--------- | -----------
`customer` | Detail of the purchasing customer; only included when the `add_customer` parameter is present and the `transaction_status` is `purchased`. The fields returned are as described in [purchase](#purchasing-on-credit).
`external_sale_page` | The detail of the confirmation page that was displayed to customers. Only included when the `add_external_sale_page` parameter is present and the `transaction_status` is `purchased`.
`purchase_iso8601_date_and_time` | The time the tickets were successfully purchased. 
`reserve_iso8601_date_and_time` | The time the tickets were successfully reserved.
`transaction_status` | One of `reserved`, `released`, `purchased`, `failed`, or `attempting` (will only be seen if the customer is being redirected to a payment page - most partners will not see this).
`trolley` | The `trolley` object. If the `transaction_status` is `reserved` or `released`, the trolley attributes are as described in the [reserve](#reserve) response. If the `transaction_status` is `purchased` the trolley attributes are as described in the [purchase](#purchase) response. Note that if the `transaction_status` is `released` you should ignore the value of `minutes_left_on_reserve`.
