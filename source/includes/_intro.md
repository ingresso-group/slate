# Introduction

##About TicketSwitch

Ingresso's TicketSwitch software has been in operation for over 10 years enabling 
millions of ticket transactions. Our solution connects ticketing suppliers
through to a wide range of electronic distribution channels.  

On one side the ticket supplier is able to increase distribution at reduced
costs, whilst on the other side distribution channels can offer customers tickets right up until
the event begins.

By connecting to the TicketSwitch API you aren't shown an `allocation` for a block of tickets at the
back of the theatre, or the last few tickets to an attraction. It
connects you right into the ticket office's very own **LIVE inventory**, giving you access to the best availability and pricing. 


##About the TicketSwitch API

The TicketSwitch API is primarily designed for partners that want to sell Ingresso's tickets (normally on their website). It allows partners to:

1. Find available `events` from multiple supplier ticketing systems through one standard API. You can filter by location, date / time, venue, product category, etc.

2. See all of the available `performances` for an `event`

2. Search live **availability** of tickets for a performance, including full seat selection.

3. **Reserve** tickets on the supplier's ticketing system in real time

4. **Purchase** tickets

5. Process certain types of **payments** or purchase tickets on credit (depending on your setup)
